      "The Video Editor for the OneDay web app allows users to record using their webcam, upload videos, use videos from a digital library and edit them. The Video Editor uses browser apis such as Media Capture and Streams and merges video and audio streams onto a HTML 5 canvas to allow multiple video streams to be rendered. IndexedDB stores the settings and video and thumbnail object urls locally for quick retrieval. The Video Editor also allows users to send and publish videos to a variety of contacts both in the OneDay platform and ad hoc users as needed.",

Users could see Call To Action hero cards on the dashboard letting them know important information about the state of their store. They also had environment and deployment cards to show the status of both on the dashboard. They were able to see the process of deployments as a timeline showing build, testing and deployment to the environment.",
